<h1> Cities Where I Have Lived</h1>

<p> I was born in New York City,
  but only lived there until I was
   about 2 years old. My family and I
    moved to Long Valley, New Jersey,
    where I spent most of my life, from
    the ages of 2 to 26. In 2015, my sister
    and brother in law moved to Longmont, Colorado,
    and my mother and I followed along. That is where
    I still live today and will most likely live for
    the foreseeable future and possibly the rest of my life.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>New York City, New York</strong></li>
  <li><em>Long Valley, New Jersey</em></li>
  <li><strong>Longmont, Colorado</strong></li>
</ul>

<h1> Cities I Would Like to Visit</h1>
<p> Each of these cities are obviously major tourist destinations and vacation spots for many
  Americans, and people all around the world. Each of the cities I listed is somewhere I have seen
  pictures of in magazines or on the internet, somewhere movies and tv shows I have watched over the years
  have taken place, and is also somewhere where I have either friends or family. I have not traveled as
  much in my life as I would like to so these are three places that I would definitely visit if afforded the chance.</p>

  <li>Los Angeles, California<span>wanna see some celebrities</span></li>
  <li>Seattle, Washington<span>microsoft, starbucks, and space needle</span></li>
  <li>San Antonio, Texas</span>history and architecture</span></li>
